More Enhancement Ideas 
* Powerups and collectable items during game play
* More Environment Interaction 
* Levels
* The beginning of a second level has been started, but there is still room for improvement here
* Adding an Easy/Medium/Hard mode that you can select before game play. Could regulate lives, speed, etc. 
* Making sound/silence an option 
* Generating a real score from the time and lives and display after the level is over
